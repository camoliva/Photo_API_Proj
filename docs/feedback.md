## Feedback from Luke
"Hey Cam, overall the project is clean and the flow makes sense. Your naming conventions are good, but Iâ€™d recommend using clearer list names and adding some inline comments for readability. Maybe think about adding tests in the future as well."

---

## Changes Made Based on Feedback
- Updated list names for consistency and clarity.
- Added clean comments to each table and router for easier readability and future maintenance.

---

## Notes for Next iteration
- Need to add automated tests when time allows.
- Considering the implementation of CSV export for reports.
- Will keep working on improving error handling and validation for future updates.
